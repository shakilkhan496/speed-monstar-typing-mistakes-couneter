        <h1>What is the Difference Between global scope and block scope?</h1>
        <br>
        <p> <span class="fw-bold fs-3">Global Scope:</span> <br>
            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
            global scope.
            Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
            conditional state
            can access that variable.</p>
        <p> <span class="fw-bold fs-3 mt-3">Block Scope:</span> <br>
            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
            inside the
            curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else.
            You are only
            allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

        <h1>How works JS event loop ?</h1>

        <br>
        <p> <span class="fw-bold fs-3 mt-3">JS event loop:</span> <br>
            Before we discuss the event loop, lets first go through the function of the task queue.

            Back to our timeout example, once the Web API finishes executing the task, it doesn’t just push it back to
            the Call
            Stack automatically. It goes to the Task Queue.

            A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the
            queue, they
            get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the
            Task Queue,
            then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out. <br>
            The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
            Queue to
            the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available
            callbacks. If
            there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the
            same process.

        <h1>How many ways to get undefined in JS?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of
            undefined
            is the primitive value undefined.

            In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not
            the case,
            avoid overriding it.)

            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
            undefined if the
            variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value
            was not
            returned.</p>
